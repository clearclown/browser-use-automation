    "text": "Intersection management is one of the most challenging problems within the transport system. Traffic light-based methods have been efficient but are not able to deal with the growing mobility and social challenges. On the other hand, the advancements of automation and communications have enabled cooperative intersection management, where road users, infrastructure, and traffic control centers are able to communicate and coordinate the traffic safely and efficiently. Major techniques and solutions for cooperative intersections are surveyed in this paper for both signalized and nonsignalized intersections, whereas focuses are put on the latter. Cooperative methods, including time slots and space reservation, trajectory planning, and virtual traffic lights, are discussed in detail. Vehicle collision warning and avoidance methods are discussed to deal with uncertainties. Concerning vulnerable road users, pedestrian collision avoidance methods are discussed. In addition, an introduction to major projects related to cooperative intersection management is presented. A further discussion of the presented works is given with highlights of future research topics. This paper serves as a comprehensive survey of the field, aiming at stimulating new methods and accelerating the advancement of automated and cooperative intersections.",

    "text": "Research in Cooperative Intersection Management (CIM), utilizing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication among Connected and/or Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), is crucial for enhancing intersection safety and driving experience. CAVs can transceive basic and/or advanced safety information, thereby improving situational awareness at intersections. The focus of this study is on unsignalized intersections, particularly Stop Controlled-Intersections (SC-Is), where one of the main reasons involving crashes is the ambiguity among CAVs in SC-I crossing priority upon arriving at similar time intervals. Numerous studies have been performed on CIM for unsignalized intersections based on centralized and distributed systems in the presence and absence of Road-Side Unit (RSU), respectively. However, most of these studies are focused towards replacing SC-I where the scheduler provides spatio-temporal or sequence-based reservation to CAVs, or where it controls CAVs via kinematic commands. These methods cause CAVs to arrive at the intersection at non-conflicting times and cross without stopping. This logic is severely limited in real-world mixed traffic comprising human drivers where kinematic commands and other reservations cannot be implemented as intended. Thus, given the existence of SC-Is and mixed traffic, it is significant to develop CIM systems incorporating SC-I rules while assigning crossing priorities and resolving the related ambiguity. In this regard, we propose a distributed Automated Right-of-Way (AROW) algorithm for CIM to assign explicit SC-I crossing turns to CAVs and mitigate hazardous scenarios due to ambiguity towards crossing priority. The algorithm is validated with extensive experiments for its functionality, scalability, and robustness towards CAV non-compliance, and it outperforms the current solutions.",

    "text": "Conflict resolution, particularly through effective priority assignment and right-of-way negotiation, is a critical factor in maximizing intersection throughput and minimizing vehicle crossing time in Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM). This paper proposes a novel color-based round scheduling algorithm that enables simultaneous traversal of multiple vehicles on both conflicting and non-conflicting paths by segmenting the paths inside the intersection using a graph coloring technique. Unlike traditional approaches that resolve conflicts at each individual conflict point, this method eliminates conflict checking by globally coordinating vehicle movements based on color rounds. As a result, the algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and the number of conflict comparisons, which otherwise scale exponentially with the number of vehicles and conflict points. Simulations in the CARLA simulator across varying traffic densities and movement scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves intersection throughput by up to 343% compared to reservation-based methods using FCFS for priority resolution. It also reduces average crossing time by approximately 76% compared to traditional traffic signals and by 94% relative to standalone FCFS strategies. We have also demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is fair in terms of the number of vehicles crossing the intersection per route.",

    "text": "Vehicular Clouds are inherited from the cloud computing concept. Vehicles standing in a parking lot can corporate computing, sensing, communication, and physical resources. Vehicular Clouds were motivated by the realization that present- day vehicles are equipped with powerful onboard computers, powerful transceivers, and an impressive array of sensing devices. As it turns out, most of the time, the computing, storage, and communication resources available in our vehicles are chronically under-utilized. We are putting these resources to work in a meaningful way to provide computation power, which plays an essential role for service providers, transportation systems, health care, and online education in our modern society. Vehicular Clouds provide computation power to users based on a resource- sharing model. In this model, vehicle owners rent out their onboard computation powers to receive incentives in the form of payments or free parking spots. To use this computation power, there should be a way to submit jobs to the system. In this work, we develop a framework for the vehicular cloud to manage the onboard computation resource of the vehicles and computation tasks that users submit. This framework will be available to users in a software system called Vehicular Cloud Real-Time System (VCRTS). Random arrival and departure of vehicles in vehicular clouds can impact the computation nodes’ availability and lead to an interruption in the computation process. We design and implement the VCRTS based on a fault-tolerant approach to prevent interruption in job execution. Our approach uses a redundancy mechanism to handle the random nature of arrival and departure of the vehicles that are used as computation nodes.",

This type of data is often characterized by a high resource demand due to the interval at which information is measured ranges from daily down to milliseconds. Next to the frequency, the number of data sources, for example hundreds of sensors in modern airplanes generating time series concurrently, is typical for such big data scenarios. Such scenarios require the persistence of the measurements for further evaluations. In this work, we introduce an artificial data benchmark for relational, NoSQL, and NewSQL database management systems in the context of time series. We compare these databases by having multiple read and write data sources accessing the database management systems simultaneously. The evaluation shows that no tested system outperforms all other systems. While DolphinDB shows the highest read performance in single-user scenarios, CrateDB is able to show its advantages regarding when multiple users access the data simultaneously.",

    "text": "Modern data management systems are required to address new breeds of OLTAP applications. These applications demand real time analytical insights over massive data volumes not only on dedicated data warehouses but also on live mainstream production environments where data gets continuously ingested and modified. Oracle introduced the Database In-memory Option (DBIM) in 2014 as a unique dual row and column format architecture aimed to address the emerging space of mixed OLTAP applications along with traditional OLAP workloads. The architecture allows both the row format and the column format to be maintained simultaneously with strict transactional consistency. While the row format is persisted in underlying storage, the column format is maintained purely in-memory without incurring additional logging overheads in OLTP. Maintenance of columnar data purely in memory creates the need for distributed data management architectures. Performance of analytics incurs severe regressions in single server architectures during server failures as it takes non-trivial time to recover and rebuild terabytes of in-memory columnar format. A distributed and distribution aware architecture therefore becomes necessary to provide real time high availability of the columnar format for glitch-free in-memory analytic query execution across server failures and additions, besides providing scale out of capacity and compute to address real time throughput requirements over large volumes of in-memory data. In this paper, we will present the high availability aspects of the distributed architecture of Oracle DBIM that includes extremely scaled out application transparent column format duplication mechanism, distributed query execution on duplicated in-memory columnar format, and several scenarios of fault tolerant analytic query execution across the in-memory column format at various stages of redistribution of columnar data during cluster topology changes.",
